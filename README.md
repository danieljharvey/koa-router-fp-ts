# koa-router-fp-ts

A WIP new router for `koa` that uses `io-ts` validators to check input before
running to ensure validation is pushed to the very border of your application.

Somewhat inspired by `Servant`.

## Development install

```
yarn install

# check those types
yarn typescript:watch

# run those tests
yarn test:watch
```
